# PeerKit Server

PeerKit is under heavy development. We don't recommend trying to run it yourself yet.


Installing:

`npm install`

PeerKit Server is extremely alpha and not yet available on NPM.

Running:

     
    var PeerKitServer = require('peerkit-server');
    var server =  new PeerKitServer();


Thanks for checking out PeerKit. We're working on improving documentation and commenting.
